# Property Finder Project Build With Laravel

A laravel property finder project for people to look and post properties for rent, shared rent (finding roomates), or lease takeovers. 
It implements cool APIs and libraries such as Algolia, dropzone.js, galleria.js, google maps, geolocation, and smarty streets, among others.
There is plenty of refactoring pending, plus testing, which will be taken care of soon.

## Algolia's Example

### Filtering and Faceting

I used Algolia's filtering and faceting capabilities in order to allow the user to filter down their search results by any set of different 
attributes.

### Instant Search (Autocomplete)

I used a jQuery plugin I developed myself (I will make it available soon) in order to have the autocomplete suggestionsfunctionality with Algolia 
to predict and suggest what the user might be looking for.

## Smartystreets

I used the Smartystreets JavaScript API in order to help users identify the address of the property they were wanting to upload or publish
