A laravel property finder project for people to look and post properties for rent, shared rent (finding roomates), or lease takeovers. 
It implements cool APIs and libraries such as Algolia, dropzone.js, galleria.js, google maps, geolocation, and smarty streets, among others.
There is plenty of refactoring pending, plus testing, which will be taken care of soon.
